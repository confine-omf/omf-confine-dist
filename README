** Current options are:

- make all
Execute all needed to have the CONFINE image.

- make target
Checks out a specific branch (master or testing) or tag (tags/v0.1, etc.) from each project (confine-dist, openwrt and packages) and compiles a CONFINE image for that target. The branch/tag is specified by the environment variable CONFINE_VERSION (testing by default). 
To compile tag v0.1 just do:
make target CONFINE_VERSION=tags/v0.1

- make prepare
Prepare the download dir if not existing and point the feeds.conf file to the proper place.
 
- make menuconfig
Provides a ncurses menuconfig from OpenWRT and copy the .config file inside my_configs/

- make kernel_menuconfig
Provides a ncurses menuconfig from the linux kernel and copy the .config file inside my_configs/

- make sync
Syncronize current files/configs directories with openwrt build tree. Needed when you update confie-dist code (git pull).

- make clean
Removes from $(BUILD_DIR) bin/ and build_dir/ directories

- make dirclean
Removes from $(BUILD_DIR) bin/, build_dir/, staging_dir/ and toolchain/ directories

- make distclean
Removes everything you have compiled and configured -- leaves $(BUILD_DIR) like after a clean checkout

- make mrproper
Removes everything leaving just the original files

** Variables:

J = number of process for compilation time
V = verbosity level

For instance: make all V=99 J=4

** Directories

- files/
All files you put inside this directory will be copyied to openwrt root filesystem

- packages/
All packages here will be copyied inside package/ openwrt directory. If you add a new package, remember to do "menuconfig" to select it

- configs/
In the first checkout this configs will be copyied to OpenWRT source tree (owrt_config & kernel_config)

- my_configs/
When you execute a menuconfig or kernel_menuconfig, the new config files will be copyied here. So if you want to commit the changes just copy them to configs/ dir
 
- images/
Output image directory

- openwrt/
OpenWRT source tree

** Output image:

When compilation finishes, you will find the output images inside images/ directory

If you need other kind of images (VMware, VBOX and so on) check inside src/bin/x86/ directory

To copy it in a compact flash or usb stick: dd if=images/IMAGE_FILE of=/dev/sdX
